# Theme-Selector-Extension

This is my Color Theme Selector Chrome Extension project. I am currently working on this and trying to learn how to manipulate the DOM through several javascript files and using an extension to accomplish that. This extension will allow the user to select a premade color theme to change whichever current theme they have on their site. This will include options like light and dark mode as well as seasonal color schemes.

I am using Javascript, JQuery, CSS, and HTML to build my extension and to interact with the webpage's DOM. I hope to finish this in the next few weeks and get it published to the Chrome Web Store.
